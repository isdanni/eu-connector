## Tech Stack

THis project chooses to use **Ionic**, **Angular**, and **Capacitor** to build a cross-platform mobile application for its performance and compatibility(so it runs on both **Android** and **iOS** platforms, as well as **web browsers**). It also has a large collection of native features of mobile devices such as geolocation, which is essential for the implementation of this app. Capacitor allows your web application to run natively on mobile devices, which results in a better performance and faster load times compared to traditional applications.
